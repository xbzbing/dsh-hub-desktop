# DSH Hub Desktop

[中文](README.md)

![dsh-hub-desktop](design/banner/dsh-hub-desktop-banner-en.png)

> A personal side project. Mainly solves the problem of constantly switching between documentation pages and `dsh` pages when working on remote development machines.
> My `OpenCode-go` and `mimo-code-plan` were both about to expire, so I designed a prototype with OpenDesign and implemented it using `dsh` — and `DSH Hub` was born.
> Total `dsh` usage: 395 rounds, 7,784 steps, 1,528M tokens.

A personal Electron desktop tool for managing multiple **dsh** (DeepSeek Harness) instances — local processes, SSH tunnels, and remote HTTP connections, all in one place. Authentication integrates with the dsh-auth-gateway protocol (password + TOTP + HttpOnly Cookie injection), with a credential vault for silent login using saved passwords.

Since I don't have an Apple Developer Account, I can't distribute a signed app. You'll need to `clone` the repo and build with `pnpm dist:mac`.

## Code signing policy

See [CODE_SIGNING.md](CODE_SIGNING.md) for the Windows installer code signing policy. Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io), certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org).

Privacy policy: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) — this app collects no personal data, contains no telemetry, and only connects to endpoints you configure.

## Features

- **Unified Instance Management**: Local registry with atomic writes, rolling backups, corruption recovery, and schema migration. Wizard-based creation → startup → detail page for start/stop/edit/open/delete
- **Three Transport Types**: Unified status channel with transport-specific dispatch
  - `local`: Spawn local processes
  - `ssh`: Tunnels with exponential backoff watchdog for auto-reconnection
  - `http/https`: Remote direct connection
- **Integrated Authentication**: Gateway five-state detection (login page / OTP / onboarding / API 401 / no auth required). Auth panel with full state flow (password → 6-digit OTP / backup codes → lockout countdown). **Silent login with saved passwords** (after checking "Remember password", no re-entry needed on restart/session expiry — passwords never cross process boundaries)
- **WebView Integration**: Partitioned cookie injection (inject before loadURL), 302/401 request interception, session expiry signal-driven re-authentication
- **Credential Vault**: System keychain (safeStorage), remembered by default after login (uncheck to opt out); instant clear on uncheck/forget
- **Audit Log**: Whitelist projection, credentials never stored
- **SSH Security**: TOFU host fingerprint verification (trust on first use / reject on change), passwords passed via ephemeral memory channel
- **Plugin Management**: List installed plugins for the instance's environment in the detail page (icon / name / version / npm / GitHub / install source), with install, check-for-update, and uninstall. Update checks evaluate both the dsh main package and sub-package peers for compatibility, warning instead of upgrading when incompatible; plugins with host-side code prompt an instance restart after changes; metadata is localized to the UI language
- **Tray / Notifications / Auto-start**: Configurable

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Desktop Framework | Electron 43 + electron-vite 5 + Vite 7 |
| UI | React 18 + zustand + hand-written CSS (OKLch light/dark themes) |
| Language | TypeScript 5.9 (strict + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) |
| Validation | zod 4.6.5 (sole runtime dependency) |
| Testing | Vitest 4 (unit) · Playwright `_electron` (E2E) · Contract tests (against real gateway) |

> Vite 8 / TypeScript 7 / React 19 are intentionally avoided (per version line review — do not upgrade).

## Architecture

```
src/
├─ shared/          Framework-agnostic core (shared between node + web, never imports electron)
│  ├─ endpoint.ts   URL parsing/normalization (protocol-first, host:port disambiguation, IPv6, loopback detection)
│  ├─ contracts.ts  Instance model (zod discriminated unions) + IPC channel constants + IpcResult envelope + schema migration
│  ├─ settings.ts   Non-sensitive preferences (language/theme/tray/auto-start/notifications)
│  ├─ i18n/         Flat key → {zh,en} message catalog
│  └─ bridge.ts     Preload bridge interface types + app channel constants
├─ main/            Main process (single location for all electron globals)
│  ├─ index.ts      Window / app://hub protocol + CSP / assembly
│  ├─ ipc/register.ts  All ipcMain.handle registrations; input zod validation → error envelope

│  └─ shell/        Tray / native settings / notifications (injectable implementation)
├─ preload/         contextBridge whitelist, only exposes dshHub.*
└─ renderer/        React shell + views · zustand store · i18n guardrails
tests/e2e/          Playwright _electron

```

**Core Design Conventions** (see `AGENTS.md` for details):

- **IPC Envelope**: All channels return `{ok:true,value} | {ok:false,code,message}` with stable error codes; renderer maps codes to messages. New channels follow a fixed four-step process (contracts → register → bridge/preload → tests)
- **Framework-Agnostic Core**: shared / registry / transport / auth / vault / audit never import electron
- **Instance Model**: `transport: local|ssh|http` × `authMode: auto|none|gateway`; transport is immutable after creation

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node 22+, pnpm 11.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev            # Start dev server + Electron window
```

In restricted/sandboxed environments, install requires additional parameters (pnpm store and electron cache must target writable directories):

```bash
pnpm install --store-dir=/tmp/pnpm-store --cache-dir=/tmp/pnpm-cache
ELECTRON_CACHE=/tmp/electron-cache node node_modules/electron/install.js  # If postinstall is skipped
```

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Dev server + Electron window |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Type check node + web + e2e projects |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint (flat config) |
| `pnpm test` | Unit tests (vitest) |
| `pnpm build` | Build all three targets (required before E2E) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright `_electron` tests |
| `pnpm test:contract` | Auth contract tests against local dsh-auth-gateway source; requires `DSH_AUTH_GATEWAY_SRC=/path/to/dsh-auth-gateway` |

**Testing notes**: E2E cases use an isolated temp directory via `DSH_HUB_DATA_DIR`; instances and credentials are synthetic data constructed in the test environment. CI failure artifacts include only Playwright error contexts, traces, UI screenshots, and audit logs; the credential vault file (`vault/credentials.json`) is never uploaded, even though its contents are ciphertext. If a future test must pre-seed vault data, it must use mock data constructed in the test environment and document its construction here.

Release commands fall into two categories: "local packaging & verification" and "public Release." A public Release supports two distribution modes, declared in the release notes' "distribution" section: `source-only` (source code, tags, and Release Notes only) and `windows-unsigned` (additionally ships a locally built, unsigned Windows installer `DSH-Hub-Setup-<version>.exe` plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`). No mode uploads macOS binaries (`.app`, `.dmg`, `.zip`), auto-update metadata (`latest-*.yml`), or diff intermediates (`.blockmap`); `scripts/release/lib.mjs` enforces an artifact-shape allowlist. The unsigned Windows installer triggers a SmartScreen "unknown publisher" prompt on first run.

Local packaging commands are retained; the unsigned, un-notarized macOS artifacts are only suitable for development, local verification, and controlled testing:

```bash
pnpm dist:mac:zip      # macOS zip, for local verification
pnpm dist:mac          # Generate unsigned macOS .app, for local verification
pnpm dist:win          # Windows NSIS (on Windows)
pnpm release:checksums # Generate SHA256SUMS.txt (uploaded with the installer for windows-unsigned)
pnpm release:check     # Release rehearsal; validates distribution mode and artifact list
```

Before a public release, run `CI=true pnpm release:check -- --pre` and confirm the release notes' distribution mode and artifact list are self-consistent. The rehearsal prints mode-specific closure steps (`source-only` or `windows-unsigned`): create a draft Release, confirm the assets, then Publish; see [`docs/release-policy.md`](docs/release-policy.md). macOS binary distribution still requires Apple Developer ID signing, notarization, clean-machine verification, and auditable update metadata checksums.

> In non-TTY environments, `pnpm <script>` requires `CI=true` (pnpm 11 dependency checks abort without a TTY).

## Data Directory

- Runtime data: `<userData>/` (overridable via `DSH_HUB_DATA_DIR` environment variable);
  Instance registry at `<userData>/registry/instances.json`
- In-repo `hub-data/` is for local runs / E2E data (gitignored; E2E auto-isolates to `hub-data/e2e*`)

## Security & Credential Discipline

- Registry / audit / logs / documentation **never store** passwords, OTPs, cookies, or private keys;
  passwords and OTPs are only passed ephemerally via IPC parameters and reside in memory
- Vault writes: **remembered by default** after login (user can uncheck); degraded mode (keychain unavailable) never persists to disk
- Audit records are constructed via whitelist projection (object spread prohibited), structurally preventing credential leaks
- SSH host key TOFU: trust on first fingerprint confirmation, **reject on any fingerprint change**;
  recovery requires explicit forgetting of that host fingerprint
- When silent login uses a saved vault password, the password never crosses process boundaries: the main process retrieves it directly, with no read-back channel to the renderer

## Documentation

- Release strategy (committed): [`docs/release-policy.md`](docs/release-policy.md)
- Archive: the first demo's design / requirements / implementation plan / UI demo / design tokens
  have been moved to [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) (no longer authoritative; kept for historical reference)
- Task tracking documents (dev task lists, review reports, delivery checklists, packaging/release rehearsals, security audit reports, etc.)
  are **local documents**, organized by milestone in `docs/local/ms-<N>/` (currently `ms-1`), excluded from git
  (one-time task tracking; see `.gitignore`)
- Repository-level development rules: `AGENTS.md`
